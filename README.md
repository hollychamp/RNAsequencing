# RNAsequencing

Mapping bacterial transcripts to already assembled genomes of the same strain. 

Assembled genomes obtained through hybrid sequencing performed by microbesNG. 

Mapping and feature counts performed on the Iridis5 high-performance computer cluster. Differential gene expression analysis performed using EdgeR in RStudio. 

Work in progress.
